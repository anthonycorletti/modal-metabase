> [!WARNING]
> This deployment isn't tuned for production workloads. Use it as a proof of concept.
> You should provision a separate database like postgres for example and set [environment variables](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-the-metabase-jar-file) appropriately to provision the database and make connections to store whatever data you need to. Metabase supports a [wide range](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/databases/connecting) of datastores, making it a great choice for data vis that complements your data eng/ ML work running on Modal.
